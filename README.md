# AskAI

An iOS Shortcut that uses the OpenAI API to answer your questions. 

## Requirement:

* Apple devices: iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and CarPlay. 
* An OpenAI API key. 

To obtain an OpenAI API key, log in to your account and find it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). If you don't have an account, [sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup) for one. As of March 24, 2023, the cost for using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is $0.002 per 1,000 tokens, with 1,000 tokens equating to roughly 750 words. For example, if you asked, `What is the capital of the US?` and received the answer `Washington D.C.` that would amount to 13 tokens, or $0.000026.

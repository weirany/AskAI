# AskAI

An iOS Shortcut that allows hands-free Apple Watch conversations with AI, utilizing the OpenAI API. 

## Requirement:

* Apple Watch (It works on other Apple devices too. But the hands-free focus works best on Apple Watch.)
* An OpenAI API key.

To obtain an OpenAI API key, log in to your account and find it [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). If you don't have an account, [sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup) for one. As of March 26, 2023, the cost for using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is $0.002 per 1,000 tokens, with 1,000 tokens equating to roughly 750 words. For example, if you asked, `What is the capital of the US?` and received the answer `Washington D.C.` that would amount to 13 tokens, or $0.000026.
